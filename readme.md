## Quickly and easily build real-time communications into your web application 
With Azure SignalR Service, adding real-time communications to your web application is as simple as provisioning a 
serviceâ€”no need to be a real-time communications guru!

## Getting Started

For more information on modules, see the [Go modules wiki](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules).

With go get:
```
go get -u github.com/devigned/signalr-go
```

If you need to install Go, follow [the official instructions](https://golang.org/dl/)
